Coda
======

Coda is a Horizon dashboard and panel (both share the name) that facilitates resource clean up of a project once that project is no longer needed http://openstack.org

Coda Dashboard
----------------
Coda Dashboard is an extension for OpenStack Dashboard that provides a UI for
Coda. 

For developer purposes, please place OpenStack Dashboard extension file, located
at *local/_42_coda.py* under horizon/openstack_dashboard/local/enabled
directory and run horizon as usual.

You will need to add the following code to the end of your local_settings.py

   def load_coda():
       import imp
   
       #Go up a level, coda should be installed there.
       local_settings_dir = os.path.split(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)))[0]
       local_settings_dir+="/dashboards/coda"
   
       #print local_settings_dir
       module = imp.load_source("coda", "%s/coda.py" % local_settings_dir)
       for attr in dir(module):
           if not attr.startswith('_'):
               globals()[attr] = getattr(module, attr)
   
   load_coda()

This makes sure that the coda.py file containing your settings are imported properly. This is probably a hack
but I haven't found a better way to do this yet.
